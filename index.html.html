        <h2>The beginning of computers</h2>
        <p>The first computer was made in 1801 by a person named: "Joseph Marie". The first computer was a machine that used punch cards to automatically weave fabric designs. In 1822 an english mathematician Charles Babbage conceives of a steam-driven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables of numbers. The project, was funded by the English government, unfortunately though it was a failure. In 1941 Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, design a computer that can solve 29 equations simultaneously. This marks the first time a computer is able to store information on its main memory.</p>

        <h2>Upgrades and improvements to computers</h2>
        <p>Over time computers rapidly improved. In 1946 Mauchly and Presper leave the University of Pennsylvania and recieved funding from the Census Bureau to build the UNIVAC. Which was the first commercial computer for business and government applications. In 1953 a person named "Grace Hopper" developed the first computer language, which eventually became known as "COBOL". In 1958 two people named Jack Kibly and Robert Noyce unveiled a integrated circuit, known as a computer chip. This resulted in Kilby being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for his work. In 1977 Radio Shack began production on the TRS-80, which sold like crazy. This was the first computer that anyone could use and write any program they wanted. In 1981 The first IBM computer codenamed: "Acorn" is introduced. In 1985 Microsoft announces Windows, which was the company's response to Apple's GUI. In 1996 Sergey Brin and Larry Page develop the Google search engine at Standford University.</p>

Which is able to bring computer functions into a smartphone. In 2010 Apple unveils the iPad, changing the way consumers view media and jumpstarting the dormant tablet computer sgement.In 2015 apple creates the Apple Watch, while Mircosoft releases Windows 10.
